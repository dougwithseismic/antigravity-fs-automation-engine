# Introduction


- **Growth Engineers**: Who need to rapidly experiment with user flows, onboarding experiences, and conversion funnels without waiting for backend deployment cycles.
- **CRO Specialists**: Who want to implement complex A/B tests and personalization logic that goes beyond simple text swaps.
- **Frontend Developers**: Who want to decouple business logic from UI components, making their applications more flexible and easier to maintain.

## Why is it important?

- **Iteration Speed**: Change workflow logic instantly without redeploying your application.
- **Client-Side Execution**: Access the full context of the browser (cookies, local storage, DOM) to make smarter decisions.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with Next.js, Hono, and React Flow, it fits perfectly into modern web development workflows.
