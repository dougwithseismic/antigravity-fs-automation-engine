# Introduction

Antigravity is a workflow engine that brings automation to where users actually are: the browser.

Unlike traditional automation platforms like N8N or Make.com that run everything on a server, Antigravity lets workflows pause for human (or AI agent) input and resume with full context intact - no webhook hell, no state reconstruction nightmares.

## Who is this for?

- **Engineers exploring hybrid execution models**: Who want to understand how workflows can seamlessly span server and client
- **Teams building human-in-the-loop systems**: Who need workflows that pause for approvals, decisions, or data entry
- **Developers integrating AI agents**: Who want agents to participate in workflows alongside humans
- **Anyone tired of Make.com's limitations**: Who've hit the wall trying to build interactive workflows in server-only platforms

## Why does this matter?

Most automation tools assume workflows run completely unattended on a server. But real-world processes often need human judgment or AI agent input at critical moments.

Traditional platforms handle this badly:
- Workflows have to end and restart (losing context)
- State reconstruction via correlation IDs and webhooks
- No real-time feedback for users
- Limited UI interactivity

Antigravity flips the model:
- **Pause/resume with preserved context**: Workflows don't end, they wait
- **Client-side execution**: Nodes can run in the browser with rich UIs
- **Real-time state sync**: No polling, instant updates
- **Composable components**: Visual language built in Storybook
