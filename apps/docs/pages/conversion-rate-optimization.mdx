# Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) is the systematic process of increasing the percentage of website visitors who take a desired action—be it filling out a form, becoming a customer, or otherwise engaging with your content.

Antigravity changes the game by allowing you to implement CRO strategies **without touching your core codebase**.

## The Antigravity Approach

Traditional CRO often requires waiting for engineering cycles to deploy simple changes. Antigravity moves this logic to the browser, empowering growth teams to move fast.

### 1. Friction Reduction
Identify where users are getting stuck and deploy instant fixes.
- **Form Analytics**: Trigger workflows when users spend too long on a specific field.
- **Error Handling**: Automatically show helpful tooltips or chat widgets when a user encounters a validation error multiple times.

### 2. Smart Incentives
Don't just offer a discount to everyone. Use Antigravity to offer incentives only when necessary.
- **Exit Intent**: Detect cursor movement towards the browser chrome and trigger a "Wait! Don't go" modal.
- **Idle Detection**: If a user has been staring at the pricing page for 60 seconds, trigger a workflow to slide in a "Need help deciding?" chat prompt.

## Implementing CRO Workflows

### Step 1: Define the Trigger
Every optimization starts with a user action.
- `Page Load`
- `Element Click`
- `Scroll Depth`
- `Inactivity`

### Step 2: Analyze Context
Use **Condition Nodes** to check the state of the user.
- Is this a returning visitor?
- Do they have items in their cart?
- What device are they using?

### Step 3: Execute Action
Modify the DOM or trigger external events.
- `Inject HTML`: Add a banner or modal.
- `Modify Style`: Highlight a button.
- `Send Event`: Log the interaction to your analytics provider (Segment, GA4, Mixpanel).

## Best Practices

1.  **One Goal Per Workflow**: Keep your workflows focused on a single KPI.
2.  **Non-Intrusive**: Avoid blocking the user's main path unless absolutely necessary.
3.  **Measure Everything**: Always connect your workflows to an analytics node to track performance.
