# Personalization

Personalization is about delivering the right content to the right person at the right time. Unlike A/B testing, where you are trying to find a "winner" for everyone, personalization acknowledges that different segments of users have different needs.

Antigravity gives you access to the full **Browser Context**, allowing for deep personalization without complex backend integrations.

## Data Sources

What data can you use to personalize?

### 1. Geo-Location (Client-Side)
Use the user's IP or browser settings to determine their approximate location.
- *Use Case*: Show "Shipping to [Country]" banners.
- *Use Case*: Display pricing in the local currency symbol.

### 2. Traffic Source (Referrer)
Where did the user come from?
- **Google/SEO**: Show content relevant to their search query.
- **Social Media**: Show a viral landing page variation.
- **Email Campaign**: If they clicked a link in your newsletter about "Shoes", highlight the Shoe category on the homepage.

### 3. User History (Cookies / LocalStorage)
- **Returning Visitor**: "Welcome back! Pick up where you left off."
- **Cart Abandoner**: If a specific cookie exists, show a discount code bar at the top of the page.

## Building Personalization Workflows

### The "Router" Pattern
Instead of a simple 50/50 split, use a **Switch Node** or multiple **If/Else Nodes** to route users.

**Example: Industry Personalization**
1.  **Trigger**: Page Load
2.  **Condition**: URL parameter `?utm_industry=finance`
3.  **True**: Swap hero image to "Bank Building" and text to "Secure solutions for Finance".
4.  **False**: Check `?utm_industry=healthcare`...

## Real-Time Behavioral Adaptation

Personalization isn't just static rules; it's reacting to what the user does *right now*.

- **Scroll Interest**: If a user scrolls rapidly past the "Features" but stops at "Pricing", trigger a workflow to highlight the "Enterprise Plan" benefits.
- **Click Rage**: If a user repeatedly clicks a non-interactive element, pop up a "Can I help you find something?" widget.

## Privacy First

Antigravity runs in the user's browser. This means you can often personalize the experience **without** sending sensitive data to your servers, keeping user data private and secure while still offering a tailored experience.
